The goal of this project was to develop a machine learning-based model capable of detecting fake news with high accuracy. To achieve this, we used Microsoft's DeBERTa (Decoding-enhanced BERT
with disentangled attention) model, known for its exceptional performance in natural language processing. We trained and evaluated this model on a dataset specific to fake news, and then
created a user interface to test the model.
